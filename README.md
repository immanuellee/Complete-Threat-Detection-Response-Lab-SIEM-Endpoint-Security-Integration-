<h1>Complete Threat Detection & Response Lab (SIEM + Endpoint Security Integration)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
(This Project is Scraped for now) This project involves setting up a Complete Threat Detection & Response Lab by integrating a SIEM system with endpoint security tools to monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats. It combines centralized logging, network traffic analysis, and endpoint detection to simulate a real-world enterprise environment where security events are collected, correlated, and addressed through automated workflows.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>SIEM Platform: Splunk (for centralized log management and threat detection)</b> 

- <b>Endpoint Security: Wazuh (for endpoint monitoring and threat response)</b>
  
- <b>Scripting Languages: PowerShell (Windows), and Python(Automation) (for automation and custom alerts)</b>
  
- <b>Network Analysis Tools: Wireshark (for network traffic monitoring and analysis)</b>
  
- <b>Virtualization: UTM (for creating isolated lab environments)</b>

- <b>Firewall/IDS/IPS: pfSense, and Suricata (for network security monitoring)</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
